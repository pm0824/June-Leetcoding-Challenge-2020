'''
Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, 
write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:
1 <= w.length <= 10000
1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.

Example 1:
Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]

Example 2:
Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]

Explanation of Input Syntax:
The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. 
pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

#Solution:

class Solution:

    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        self.__prefix_sum = list(w)
        for i in range(1, len(w)):
            self.__prefix_sum[i] += self.__prefix_sum[i-1]
        
    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        target = random.randint(0, self.__prefix_sum[-1]-1)
        return bisect.bisect_right(self.__prefix_sum, target)
        
# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(w)
# param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
