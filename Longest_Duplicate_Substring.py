'''
Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)
Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  (If S does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".)

Example 1:
Input: "banana"
Output: "ana"

Example 2:
Input: "abcd"
Output: ""
 
Note:
2 <= S.length <= 10^5
S consists of lowercase English letters.

 Hint #1  
Binary search for the length of the answer. (If there's an answer of length 10, then there are answers of length 9, 8, 7, ...)
 Hide Hint #2  
To check whether an answer of length K exists, we can use Rabin-Karp 's algorithm.
